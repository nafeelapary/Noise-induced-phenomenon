#  Simulation Of Noise-induced-phenomenon
#Fluctuations or noise have played a dynamic role in the history of science. Noise was considered
a nuisance to be eliminated or avoided. Here we sample some noise-induced phenomena
concerning brownian motion. Brownian motion is the most typical example of a classic
fluctuations problem that allows us to introduce several ideas and definitions. However, it
is not easy to gain an intuitive understanding of such stochastic phenomena, because their
modeling requires advanced mathematical tools. Here, we discuss a simple finite difference
algorithm and computer simulations that can be used to gain an understanding of such complex
physical phenomena using Python.
